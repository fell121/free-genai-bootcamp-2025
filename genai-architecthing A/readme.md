## Functional Requerments

The company wants to invest in ownig their infrasture.
The reason is because they there is a consern about the privacy of user data and also a consern that the cost of managed services for GenAi will greatlyin  cost

They want to invest an AI pc where they can afford spend of 10-15k
They have 300 active, students are located within the city
of Tokyo. 

## Assumtions

We are assuming that the Open-Source LLMs thet will be powerful enought to run on hardware with an investment of 10-15k.

We're just going to hook up a single server in our office to the internet and we shold have enough bandwidth to serve the 300 students


## Data Strategy

There is a conserned of copyrighted material, so we must purcuse and supply materials and store them for access in our database.

## Consideration

We're considering using IBM Granite because its an open-source model with training data that is traceable so we can avoid any copyright issues and we are able to know what is going on in the model.
