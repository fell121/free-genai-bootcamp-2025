<user:input>
    Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
</user:input>

<score_reason>
    - BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show the japanese characters, the cells are just blank
    - Bad: the begining sentence is uncessary, should just start showing the vocabulary table
    - Bad: in the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs, bacause the students needs to figure that out
    - BAD: the sentence structure is says to much we really want something that is conseptual like this: [Location] [subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

Let's work through the transcription together.
Vocabulary Table:
|    Japanese	  |   Romaji  |English                |
|               |   kuma    |   bear                |
|               |   tobira  |	door                  |
|   ---	        |    ---	  |   ---                 |
|               |   gomi	  |   garbage             |   
|               |   suteru	|   to throw away       |
|               |   deru	  |   to go out, to leave |

Possible Sentence Structure:
The sentence seems to be composed of two clauses:
A statement about bears being at the door.
A question about leaving the garbage out.
For the first clause, a possible structure could be: [Subject] + [Location] + [Existence].
For the second clause, a possible structure could be: [Object] + [Action] + [Question].
Now it's your turn! Try to figure out the particles, conjugations, and sentence structure. What do you think is the next step?
Do you want to start with the first clause or the second clause?

cheatsheet:
Step 1: Understand the sentence parts
Your sentence has two main parts:

Bears are at the door

Did you leave the garbage out?

Step 2: Vocabulary Table
Japanese	Romaji	English
くま	kuma	bear
ドア	doa	door
ごみ	gomi	garbage/trash
だす	dasu	to put out/leave out
いる	iru	to exist (for animate beings)
のこす	nokosu	to leave behind
おく	oku	to place/put
いる	iru	to be (used for animals, people)
いるか	iruka	(question form of iru)
でる	deru	to come out/leave
こわい	kowai	scary

Step 3: Possible Sentence Structure
Try using this as a template:

[Subject] + [location] + [existence verb]

(e.g., Bears + at the door + are)

[Object] + [verb (past)] + [question marker]

(e.g., garbage + put out + did you?)

Hint Time!
Use いる for the existence of animals (like bears).

Use ごみ and a verb like だす for "leave the garbage out".

Don't forget your particles — what goes between the door and the bears? What about between garbage and verb?

Make sure your verb tenses match the English question: past + question.

Japanese questions usually end with か.

The word "out" isn't directly needed — think about the verb itself implying "putting out".
